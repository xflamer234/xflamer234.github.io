        <p>On this special day, I want to express my deepest affection and gratitude for having you by my side and always keeping me in check whenever i need to set my head straight so i don't lose track of what is important.</p>
        <p>Every moment I spend with you is a special time for me even if it's for a little bit , and I am grateful for the love we share, today and always.</p>
        <p>Wishing you a Valentine's Day filled with all the happiness, warmth, and love that you bring into my life.</p>
        <p>Even though we're not together for today, i still want you to remember that you always have me and I'll always love you no matter what.
            Words can't even express the love that i have for you hun. I hope you got that rose for yourself hun because i wanted to get you something at least as a a little present so that it will remind you that you have me always. Well i could go on about more about how much i love but you know that i have genuine love for you and will always be here as i said
